# Baco-Taylor-Lab-repository
This repository hosts scripts useful for the Baco-Taylor Lab. 

The repository is segmented into scripts for video conversion, depositing imagery into BIIGLE, and for splicing image annotations with dive in-situ metadata. 

Note the filetype for the scripts will be in python (.py) or R (.R). This will dictate which program to use to work through the analysis. 

I have done my best to make it so that data can be analyzed accessibly across the lab and personal computers. This requires having some file naming conventions and folder naming conventions.

May the odds be in your favor.
